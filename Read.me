1.HTML:
  Create a simple HTML structure with a container to display the available time slots and a button to book the selected slot.

2.CSS (styles.css):
  Add some basic styling to make the interface look presentable.

3.JavaScript (script.js):
  Handle the logic for populating the available time slots and enabling the "Book Slot" button when a slot is selected.

4.That's it! With this code, you'll have a simple slot-booking system where users can click on an available time slot, and the selected slot will be highlighted.
5.The "Book Slot" button will become enabled, allowing users to proceed with their booking.

6.Keep in mind that this is just a basic example to demonstrate the concept. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle more complex logic, such as handling booked slots,
7.communicating with a server to fetch available slots, and handling errors gracefully.
